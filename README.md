<h1>MERN Boilerplate</h1>

This is a basic MERN stack boilerplate that has some basic data passed through from MongoDB to an express back end that responds with the data to an API call from the REACT front end.

The boilerplate is set up in an MVC Archtiectural pattern.

**to do**
- set up a models directory and build a schema.
- initialize the schema with some data ... look into seeds?
- get it working so it seeds and the data is passed through and rendered 
- set up scripts in the paclage.json to seed etc from one command.
- include in the readme how to run evertything. (installs, seeds, run servers)
